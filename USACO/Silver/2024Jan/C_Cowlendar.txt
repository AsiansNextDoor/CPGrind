In this problem, it is crucial to recognize that for a valid L, there are only
3 distinct remainders possible when dividing ai by L. For values that result
in the same remainder when divided by L, the difference between the two values 
must be divisible by L(for example, 3 and 5 both give a remainder of 1 when 
divided by 2, and therefore 5 - 3 is divisible by 2). This means that within a
set of 4 distinct values of array a, any possible L must divide the difference
of a pair of values in the set. Since there are only 6 distinct pairs in the
set and the maximum number we have to check as a divisor is sqrt(4*1e9), we
can find all possible values of L through this set. Checking the potential L's
in the list and adding them will yield the answer.
